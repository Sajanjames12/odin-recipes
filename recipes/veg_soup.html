    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The ultimate vegetable soup is a meal in itself, packed full with healthy veggies, spices and aromatics</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 medium Carrots</li>
        <li>2 stick Celery</li>
        <li>3 cloves Garlic</li>
        <li>1 medium Leek</li>
        <li>1 medium Onion</li>
        <li>50g Butter</li>
        <li>300g Butternut Squash</li>
        <li>1 Sweet Potatoes</li>
    </ul>          
    <h3>Seasoning</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1200 ml Chicken Stock Cube or vegetable stock</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>To garnish</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp Creme Fraiche</li>
        <li>1 tbsp SuperValu Parsley chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Begin by chopping all of the vegetables and garlic</li>
        <li>Melt the butter in a large saucepan and then add in the vegetables</li>
        <li>Sauté gently for 4-5 minutes until some of the smaller vegetables are beginning to soften</li>
        <li>Next add in approximately two thirds of the chicken or vegetable stock and bring the mixture to a slow boil and then reduce the heat and simmer for an additional 15-20 minutes or until all of the vegetables have softened down completely</li>
        <li>Using a hand blitzer, blitz the soup until it is nice and smooth. Return to the heat and bring back to a very gentle boil</li>
        <li>If you would like a thinner soup, now would be the best time to add some additional stock to thin it down. Correct the seasoning at this stage also</li>
        <li>Transfer it to your serving bowls or cups and garnish the soup with a little crème fraiche and chopped parsley</li>
        <li>Serve as required or alternatively allow the soup to cool down and then transfer it into suitable containers and freeze until required</li>
    </ol>

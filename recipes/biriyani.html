    <img src="../chicken.jpg" alt="Picture of a South Indian Dish">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Biryani is a mixed rice dish originating among the Muslims of the Indian subcontinent.Biryani (also pronounced as biriyani), literally means ” a layered rice dish in Indian cuisine.” It is made with Indian spices, rice, and usually some type of meat or in some cases without any meat, and sometimes, in addition, eggs and potatoes</p>
    <p>The exact origin of the dish is uncertain. In North India, different varieties of biryani developed in the Muslim centres of Delhi (Mughlai cuisine), Rampur, Lucknow (Awadhi cuisine) and other small principalities. In South India, where rice is more widely used as a staple food, several distinct varieties of biryani emerged from Hyderabad Deccan (where some believe the dish originated[11]) as well as Tamil Nadu (Ambur, Thanjavur, Chettinad, Salem, Dindigal), Kerala (Malabar), Telangana, and Karnataka (Bhatkal) where Muslim communities were present</p>
